#  Texas Sets 21 as the Minimum Age for Gaming 

The 21 minimum age for gaming in Texas will come into effect on September 1, 2019. This was a decision made by the Texas Legislature in House Bill 2999, which Governor Greg Abbott then signed into law.

This bill makes it unlawful for any person under 21 to engage in gambling in any form in the state of Texas. That includes casinos, racetracks, and online betting platforms. It also forbids those under 21 from entering a gambling establishment.

Penalties for violating this law include a fine of up to $5,000 and/or 180 days in jail. This new law will provide comprehensive protections against underage gambling and should be a deterrent for any minors considering gambling in Texas.

#  Texas Gaming Laws Favor Adult Players 
#

In the state of Texas, all forms of gambling are legal for adults over 18 years old. This includes casinos, horseracing, lotteries, and tribal gaming. The only exception is social gambling, which is only allowed among friends and family members.

There are no statewide regulations governing poker or other card games. However, local jurisdictions can pass their own laws prohibiting or limiting particular games. For example, the city of Houston prohibits any form of poker that isn't five-card draw.

The Texas Racing Commission oversees horseracing in the state. The commission is responsible for licensing tracks and jockeys, regulating wagers, and investigating complaints. There are six licensed horse racing tracks in Texas.

The Texas Lottery is one of the most popular forms of gambling in the state. The lottery offers scratch tickets, draw games (including Powerball and Mega Millions), and on-line games. It has also partnered with other states to offer multi-state games like Hot Lotto and Cash 5.

Indian gaming is legal in Texas under the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). There are three federally recognized tribes in Texas that operate gaming facilities: Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas, Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas, and Tigua Indian Reservation. These tribes offer a variety of casino games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and craps.

#  Texas Strikes Down Petition to Lower Gaming Age 

In response to a petition circulated in Texas to lower the legal gaming age from 21 to 18, state officials have quashed the proposal.

The petition was started by Collin County teenager, Hunter Richard. In a video posted on social media, Richard implores viewers to sign the petition in order to "give kids a chance." The petition has since garnered over 26,000 signatures.

In a statement released earlier this week, the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said that the state's constitution does not permit the change in age for gaming. "The proposed amendment would create two classes of citizens: those ages 21 and older who could legally gamble in casinos, and those younger than 21 who could not," reads the statement. "This division would be unconstitutional."

Texas isn't the only state facing this issue. In neighbouring Louisiana, a similar campaign is underway to lower the gaming age to 18. So far, that petition has amassed over 72,000 signatures.

Lowering the gaming age has been debated for years, with supporters arguing that it would help stimulate the economy by creating new jobs and generating tax revenue. Opponents of the measure argue that it would lead to increased cases of gambling addiction and other social ills.

#  Texas Stands by its Minimum Gaming Age of 21 
Texas is one of 18 U.S. states that enforce a minimum gaming age of 21. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 prohibited gambling businesses from knowingly accepting payments in connection with the participation of another person in a gambling activity that involves the use of the Internet and that is unlawful under any federal or state law. This act effectively prohibits online gambling, as well as making it more difficult for underage gamblers to participate in online casinos. 

While some people believe that the minimum age for casino gambling should be lowered to 18, many states continue to enforce a minimum age of 21 in order to reduce gambling addiction rates and protect vulnerable adults. Texas is one such state, and o landowners, casino owners, and operators within the state are required by law to verify the age of any person attempting to gamble.

Landowners who allow patrons to gamble on their premises are also responsible for ensuring that minors do not gain access to the casino. Violators can face civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment. In addition, casinos are prohibited from advertising or promoting gambling services to anyone under the age of 21. 

So far, the minimum age for casino gambling in Texas has had little impact on tourism or economic growth within the state. Some advocates believe that a lower minimum age would result in increased revenue for casinos and landowners, but opponents argue that such changes could lead to greater addiction rates and social problems.

#  The Future of Gaming in Texas Looks Bright with a Minimum Age of 21

The 21 minimum age for legal gambling in Texas will soon be a reality after the Senate passed the measure on Tuesday. This means that casino-style gaming, including slots and blackjack, would only be available to adults who are 21 and older.

Texas is the second state in the nation to raise its gambling age to 21, following Pennsylvania’s lead. The hope is that this measure can help to curb problem gambling and protect young adults from developing gambling addictions.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for individuals and their families. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, approximately 2% of the population meets the criteria for pathological gambling, while another 4-6% experiences some degree of problem gambling.

Gambling addiction can have a number of negative consequences, including financial hardship, relationship problems, job loss, and even suicide. Young adults are particularly vulnerable to developing gambling addictions, which is why it’s important to protect them by raising the minimum age for legal gambling.

The passage of this bill is good news for Texans and for the gaming industry as a whole. It shows that lawmakers are taking the issue of problem gambling seriously and are committed to doing what they can to protect people from developing addictive behaviors.

While there may be some opposition to this measure, I believe that it will ultimately be beneficial for both individuals and businesses in Texas. I look forward to seeing how this bill progresses through the legislative process and hope that it will be signed into law soon.
