#  State Approves Leander's Casino Plans in Catskills

Leander's casino project in the Catskills was approved by the state on Thursday. It will be the first full-scale casino to open in the area in more than a decade.

The $365 million casino resort is expected to create 1,500 jobs and bring in more than $200 million in annual revenue. In addition to the casino, the project will include a hotel, spa, and entertainment complex.

The developers of the project are a group of investors led by Leander Kahney, the CEO of Wired magazine. Kahney is a native of the Catskills region and believes that the casino will help revive the area's economy.

"This is something that we're very proud of," said Kahney. "It's going to mean jobs and economic opportunity for a lot of people who need it."

Opponents of the project say that it will have a negative impact on the local community, but supporters argue that it will provide much-needed jobs and revenue. The developers have promised to invest millions of dollars into local businesses and charities.

Construction on the casino is scheduled to begin this summer and it is expected to open in 2020.

The new casino resort is part of a larger effort to revive the Catskills economy. In recent years, the region has seen an increase in tourism thanks to its abundant outdoor recreation opportunities and charming small towns.
