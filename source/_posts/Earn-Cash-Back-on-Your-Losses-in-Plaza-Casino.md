#  Get Paid to Play at Plaza Casino

Online casinos are always coming up with new and innovative ways to keep players engaged, and of course, to entice new players to sign up. One such recent innovation is the offer of paid play at online casinos. In this article we’re going to take a look at what this entails and how you can get in on the action.

# What is Paid Play?

Paid play is exactly what it sounds like: you are paid to play casino games. In most cases, you will be given a certain amount of money to start with, and then you can continue playing as long as you want until it’s all gone. The idea behind it is that you can “test drive” the casino games and see if you like them before depositing your own money.

# Who Offers Paid Play?

Most major online casinos now offer some form of paid play. In most cases, it will be available on select games only, but there are a few casinos that offer it on all their games. The exact games that are available for paid play vary from casino to casino, but typically they include slots, blackjack, roulette, and video poker.

# How Do I Get Started?

Getting started is easy – just visit the website of the casino offering paid play and sign up for an account. You may need to provide some proof of identity before you can start playing. Once you have registered for an account and logged in, select the game or games that you want to play and start gambling! Note that not all casinos allow players from every country, so check the terms and conditions before signing up.

# What Are the Risks?

There is no such thing as risk-free gambling, and paid play is no exception. One thing to keep in mind is that once your allotted time runs out, whatever money you have left over is considered your winnings (or losses) – so be careful not to go into debt just because you’re playing for free! Another thing to watch out for is Wagering Requirements; these are stipulations that require you to bet a certain amount of money before being able to cash out any winnings from your free spins or bonus money. Failure to meet Wagering Requirements often results in forfeiture of those winnings altogether. Finally, always remember that gambling can be addictive, so please gamble responsibly!
