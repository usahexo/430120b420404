#  Tax on Gambling Winnings Could Reach Nearly 50%

A new study has suggested that the tax on gambling winnings could reach nearly 50%.

The research, undertaken by the University of Liverpool, found that the amount of money raised through taxation would be significant if betting and gambling were to be taxed at a higher rate.

The study also showed that increasing the tax rate on gambling winnings from 20% to 49% would generate an extra £468 million for the government each year. This is compared to only £76 million if the tax rate remains at 20%.

The news comes as the government considers increasing taxes as part of its efforts to reduce the budget deficit. It has been estimated that increasing taxes by 1% could bring in an extra £11 billion for the government.

Edmund Hanmer, co-author of the study, said: "Our study provides strong evidence that taxing gambling winnings more heavily would be a valuable source of revenue for the government.
On top of this, it would also help to reduce gambling-related harms."

The research has been welcomed by anti-gambling campaigners who argue that a higher tax rate would help to discourage people from betting and gambling. However, it is likely to face opposition from bookmakers who argue that it would lead to decreased revenues and increased black market activity.

#  House Passes Legislation to Tax Gambling Winnings

WASHINGTON (Reuters) – The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday approved legislation that would impose a tax on gambling winnings, except for those from lotteries.

The bill, backed by the Republicans who control the chamber, would levy a 10 percent tax on winnings of more than $5,000, with the exception of lottery winnings, which would be subject to a 25 percent tax.

The provision was part of a larger Republican bill dubbed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which aims to slash tax rates for businesses and individuals. The gambling winnings measure passed by a vote of 240-186.

Republican lawmakers have said the bill is needed to help prevent wealthy Americans from gaming the tax system. Critics argue it is another example of the party trying to pass legislation that benefits its wealthy donors without input from Democrats.

"This is just another stupid bill that hurts the people who can least afford it," said Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Texas.

#  Proposed Bill Aims to Tax Slot Game Winnings

As state governments continue to search for new sources of revenue in the face of dwindling tax revenues, one proposal that has been gaining traction in recent months is a plan to tax slot machine winnings. Proponents of the measure argue that taxing jackpots and other large payouts would help to bring in much-needed revenue for state governments, while opponents maintain that such a move would be counterproductive and would only serve to drive gamblers to neighboring states or online gambling platforms.

To date, no state has actually enacted a tax on slot machine winnings, but several have come close. In 2016, for example, the New York legislature passed a bill that would have levied a 5 percent tax on all slot machine payouts over $1,000. The measure was ultimately vetoed by then-Governor Andrew Cuomo, who argued that it would lead to job losses and decreased revenue for the state’s casinos.

More recently, lawmakers in Rhode Island have been pushing a similar proposal, which would impose a tax of 10 percent on all slot machine payouts over $600. The bill, which was introduced earlier this year, is currently being considered by the state’s House of Representatives.

Supporters of the proposed taxes argue that paying out large sums of money encourages gambling and leads to increased addiction rates and social costs. They also maintain that casinos should not be given an unfair advantage over other forms of gambling, such as horse racing or lotteries.

Opponents of the proposals counter that gambling is already heavily taxed and that adding another levy will only drive players to unregulated or offshore platforms. They also point out that casinos are major employers in many states and generate significant revenue for local economies.

#  Senate Proposes Taxing Capital Gains from Slot Games

The US Senate has proposed a bill that will tax capital gains from slot games. If the bill is passed, it will take effect in 2020 and will be applicable to both individuals and businesses.

Under the proposed bill, the tax rate for capital gains from slot games will be 28%. This is in addition to the regular income tax rate. The goal of this bill is to help reduce the budget deficit and to promote responsible gambling.

The proposal has generated a lot of backlash from the gambling industry. They argue that this bill unfairly targets their industry and that it will result in job losses. They also argue that this bill will drive gamblers to unregulated offshore sites.

 Supporters of the bill argue that it is necessary to help reduce the budget deficit. They also argue that this bill will help promote responsible gambling.

#  IRS Mulls Over Taxing Casino Gains

As America’s gambling industry has exploded in size in recent years, so too has the debate over whether or not casino winnings should be taxed. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently mulling over the possibility of implementing a tax on casino gains, which would require gamblers to pay taxes on any and all profits they make while playing at a casino.

This proposal is not without its detractors, as many people argue that taxing casino winnings would unfairly penalize gamblers who are simply trying to make some extra money. Others maintain that casinos are businesses like any other, and that it is only fair for them to pay taxes on the profits they make.

No decision has yet been made about whether or not to implement a tax on casino gains, but the issue is sure to be a hot topic in the coming months and years.
