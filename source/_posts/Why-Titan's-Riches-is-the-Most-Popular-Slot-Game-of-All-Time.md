#  How Titan's Riches Became So Popular

In ancient Roman and Greek mythology, titans were deities or beings that were of great size and strength. In modern times, the term has been used to describe something that is very large or impressive. This is certainly true of the planet Saturn's largest moon, Titan.

Discovered in 1655 by Christiaan Huygens, Titan is one of the most fascinating objects in our solar system. It is the only moon with a substantial atmosphere and the only object in our solar system other than Earth that has stable bodies of liquid on its surface.

Titan's atmosphere is mostly nitrogen with a small amount of methane and hydrogen. It is very thick, about 10 times thicker than Earth's atmosphere. The temperature on the surface ranges from -290 degrees Fahrenheit to -292 degrees Fahrenheit (-179 degrees Celsius to -179 degrees Celsius).

The surface of Titan is mostly composed of water ice, which accounts for about 60% of its mass. There are also hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane, which give the moon its orange-brown color. The equatorial regions are warmer than the poles due to internal heat sources, causing methane and ethane to flow in liquid form. There are also hydrocarbon lakes and seas near the poles.

Despite its hostile environment, Titan has become a popular destination for robotic explorers. The Cassini-Huygens mission was a joint project by NASA and the European Space Agency that sent a probe to study Titan in detail. The mission ended in September 2017 after a successful 20-year run.

NASA is currently planning future missions to explore Titan further. The Dragonfly mission is a proposed quadcopter that would fly from one pole to another, studying the moon's atmosphere and surface features. The orbiter would also collect data on Saturn's magnetic field and Rings.

The interest in Titan is not just academic; it is also commercially motivated. Since 2004, NASA has been selling data collected by Cassini-Huygens to private companies such as Google and Apple Inc. These companies use the data to improve their mapping products and services. As exploration of Titan continues, it is likely that even more commercial opportunities will arise.
