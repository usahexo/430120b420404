#  Champions League draw: Where is usually san manuel indian casino La Liga in the pot?

The Champions League draw always creates a lot of interest, as the best teams in Europe compete for glory. But where is La Liga usually placed in the pot?

Well, during the group stage draw, La Liga is usually in Pot 2. This is because the top four teams from Spain usually qualify for the competition, with the fifth placed side having to go through a qualification round.

However, as we approach the latter stages of the competition, La Liga sides often find themselves in Pot 1. This is because they are among the strongest teams remaining in the Champions League, and tend to be more successful than sides from other leagues.

In fact, at this stage of the competition it's not uncommon for all four of Spain's teams to be in Pot 1. And that certainly creates some interesting match-ups!

#  Could Neymar leave Barcelona for Real Madrid? Where would he fit in at where is usually san manuel indian casino La Liga?

Neymar's future at Barcelona is in limbo, as the Brazilian superstar continues to be linked with a move to Real Madrid. Neymar has been a revelation at Camp Nou, scoring 105 goals and registering 77 assists in just 138 appearances for the club. However, reports in Spain suggest that Neymar is unhappy with his current situation at Barcelona, with Los Blancos president Florentino Perez keen on bringing the 26-year-old to the Santiago Bernabeu.

If Neymar were to leave Barcelona for Madrid, where would he fit in?

Neymar would likely slot into a front three alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, replacing Gareth Bale. This would mean that either Isco or Luka Modric would have to make way for the Brazilian, with both players struggling for game time this season. Neymar's arrival would also likely see Ronaldo return to a more central role.

There is no doubt that Neymar would be an excellent addition to the Real Madrid squad. He has everything you would want in a world-class player: speed, technique, goalscoring ability and an eye for a pass. With Ronaldo reaching the latter stages of his career, Madrid need someone who can step up and replace him as the club's main attacking threat. Neymar is more than capable of doing that.

However, there are some concerns about how he would fit into Zinedine Zidane's team. The Frenchman is known for his preference for a 4-3-3 formation, with Ronaldo often playing as a lone striker. It could be argued that Neymar's arrival would mean a change in system for Madrid, something that Zidane may not be keen on.

There is no doubt that Neymar would be an excellent addition to any team. But will he leave Barcelona for Real Madrid? Only time will tell...
