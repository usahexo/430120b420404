#  Leicester City Joins English Premier League Elite With Hard 16 Win

Leicester City continued their impressive run of form on Saturday, as they dispatched Southampton 16-0 to move into fourth place in the English Premier League. Jamie Vardy led the way with a hat-trick, while Riyad Mahrez, Shinji Okazaki, and Wes Morgan all scored twice.

It was an impressive performance by Leicester City, who have now won six consecutive games and look like a team that is destined for Champions League qualification. The Foxes have been one of the surprise packages of the Premier League this season, and they are now just two points behind third-place Manchester City.

In truth, Leicester City could have won by even more on Saturday if they had been clinical in front of goal. They had 47 shots on goal and 95% possession in the second half, but they were only able to find the back of the net 16 times.

That is still a very impressive scoreline, and it means that Leicester City now have the best attacking record in the Premier League with 53 goals scored. With Vardy and Mahrez leading the charge, there is no doubt that Leicester City will be a force to be reckoned with in the second half of the season.

#  Foxes Make it Two In a Row as They Earn Hard 16 Victory Over Newcastle

In their second game of the season, Manchester City’s foxes made it two in a row with a convincing 16-1 victory over Newcastle. Sergio Aguero led the way with 4 goals, while Raheem Sterling, Bernardo Silva and Leroy Sane also got on the scoresheet. The result sees Pep Guardiola’s side move up to second in the Premier League table, 3 points behind Liverpool.

It was a convincing performance from Manchester City, who looked like a team that is already firing on all cylinders. New signing Rodri was impressive in midfield, and the back line looked solid despite losing Aymeric Laporte to injury in the first half.

For Newcastle, this was a baptism of fire, and they will need to improve quickly if they are to survive in the Premier League this season. Martin Dubravka had a busy day in goal, and he was arguably the only Newcastle player who performed to his best.

After a difficult start to the season, things are starting to look much brighter for Manchester City. They have now won their last 2 games by a combined score of 16-1, and they will be looking to continue their good form when they take on Tottenham next weekend.

#  Leicester City Shuts Out Stoke with a Hard 16 Victory

Leicester City came out on top at King Power Stadium against Stoke City today with a score of 16 to nil. With Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy in the starting lineup together once again, they were able to dominate offensively. Mahrez had a goal and an assist, while Vardy managed two goals of his own. Marc Albrighton, Wes Morgan, and Shinji Okazaki also contributed goals to the final tally. This was a great team effort from Leicester City that resulted in their third clean sheet of the season.

The players are clearly clicking well as a unit and this is translating into some great performances on the pitch. They will need to continue this streak if they want to maintain their place at the top of the Premier League table. Up next for Leicester City is a match against Sunderland, which they should be able to win fairly easily.

#  Sunderland Triumphs Over Leicester in a Close Match Despite a Hard 16 Scoreline

Leicester City hosted Sunderland in a Premier League match that saw the home side take the lead 16-0 by halftime. But Sunderland came back after the break to score two goals, followed by an equalizer late on to earn a point in a thrilling 2-2 draw.

It was Leicester who took the lead early on as Shinji Okazaki tapped in from close range after just six minutes played. The home side continued to dominate and extend their lead before halftime, with Jamie Vardy scoring twice, Riyad Mahrez, Marc Albrighton and Wes Morgan also finding the net.

The second half started much like the first had ended, with Leicester scoring two more goals through Okazaki and Vardy. But Sunderland then started to fight back, and Jermain Defoe pulled one back in the 67th minute. Then, with just five minutes left to play, Fabio Borini equalized for Sunderland to earn them a hard-fought point.

Sunderland manager David Moyes was pleased with his team's comeback: "We could have capitulated after going 3-0 and 4-0 down, but we didn't and I'm really proud of the players for that," he said. "To get something out of the game is a good result."

#  Manchester United Edges Out Leicester City in Another Close Contest

Manchester United had to work hard to get the three points against Leicester City, but they came away with a 2-1 win.

The first half was scoreless, with both teams having their chances. In the 55th minute, Manchester United finally broke through when Marcus Rashford got on the end of a cross from Ander Herrera and headed it into the net.

Leicester City equalized in the 73rd minute when Harry Maguire headed in a free kick from Marc Albrighton, but Manchester United recaptured the lead just two minutes later when Juan Mata scored from close range.

Claude Puel made some changes to try to get Leicester City back into the game, but they were unable to find an equalizer. Manchester United held on for the win, which keeps them in second place in the Premier League table.
