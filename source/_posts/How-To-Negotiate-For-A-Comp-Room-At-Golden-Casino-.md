#  How To Negotiate For A Comp Room At Golden Casino 

Most people enjoy the convenience of casino comps, especially if they're spending a lot of time and money at the casino. There are a few things you can do to increase your chances of receiving a comp room from the casino.

Be sure to sign up for a players' card as soon as you arrive. This will help track your play and may make you eligible for different types of comps.

Gamble on games that offer better odds. The casino wants you to win, but they also want to make money. So, they're more likely to give you a comp for playing games that have good odds for the player.

Be friendly and polite to the staff. Casino employees are often responsible for doling out comps, so it helps to be on their good side. Always say thank you when you receive a comp and show appreciation for any special treatment.

Don't overspend. Casinos aren't in the business of giving away free rooms and meals; they only do so when they think it's in their best interest. So, don't go crazy at the tables – play within your budget and save your big bets for special occasions.

If all else fails, ask for a comp room. It never hurts to ask, and the worst that can happen is that the casino says no. Be polite, humble and reasonable in your request, and don't be afraid to bargain a little bit.
