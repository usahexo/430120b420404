#  Gran Canaria to be a base for European sports betting industry

Gran Canaria is becoming an important base for the European sports betting industry. The sector, which has boomed in recent years, is moving to the island to take advantage of its favourable tax regime and the growing popularity of gambling among Europeans.

The industry has been drawn to Gran Canaria by its low corporate taxes – just 5 per cent compared with the standard rate of 20-25 per cent in many other European countries. In addition, there are no stamp duties or value-added taxes on bets, making the island a haven for bookmakers.

“The Canary Islands are one of the most competitive jurisdictions in Europe for online betting companies,” said José Antonio Rivero, director of the Gran Canaria-based business consultancy firm BCGC.

The sector is expanding rapidly on the island. In 2008 there were just 16 sports betting firms registered in Gran Canaria; now there are more than 80, with a combined workforce of around 1,000 people. The sector is forecast to grow by around 10 per cent a year over the next few years.

Gambling is becoming increasingly popular in Europe, with annual revenues from sports betting reaching €10 billion ($13.6 billion) last year, up from €5 billion in 2006. Germans account for almost half of all sports betting spending in Europe, followed by Britons and Spaniards.

Industry analysts say that Gran Canaria’s burgeoning tourism industry – it welcomed more than five million visitors last year – could make it a key player in the sports betting market. “Gran Canaria offers an attractive proposition for companies looking to set up shop in Europe as it combines favourable taxation with an influx of tourists who like to gamble,” said Francisco Polo de la Torre at BearingPoint Spain.

#  Gran Canaria to become the new Mecca for sports betting enthusiasts

In a move that is likely to excite sports betting enthusiasts around the world, Gran Canaria has been chosen as the new Mecca for sports betting. The decision follows a review of the Spanish gambling market by the government, which highlighted opportunities for growth in the sector on the island.

Gran Canaria is already well known for its thriving tourism industry, and it is hoped that the addition of sports betting will attract even more visitors to the island. In particular, authorities are targeting Asian markets such as China and South Korea, where there is a large demand for gambling services.

Sports betting is currently one of the most popular forms of gambling, and it is expected that the new casino complex in Gran Canaria will be a major draw for tourists. The complex will include a race track, a casino, and a range of other entertainment facilities, making it an all-in-one destination for those looking to enjoy a day or evening out.

The government has already pledged €100 million to help fund the development of the new complex, which is expected to create 1,000 jobs on the island. It is hoped that this will not only benefit local businesses but also help to reduce unemployment on Gran Canaria.

Sports betting enthusiasts can look forward to enjoying some of the best facilities in the world when they visit Gran Canaria. With its stunning beaches and year-round warm climate, the island is sure to become a popular destination for those looking to bet on their favourite sports teams or events.

#  Sports betting moves to Gran Canaria

The Canary Islands are a popular tourist destination for people from all over the world, and with good reason. The archipelago has year-round sunshine, stunning beaches and a laid-back Mediterranean atmosphere.

Now, the islands are set to become even more popular with tourists, as sports betting moves to Gran Canaria. In March of this year, the Spanish government issued a license to a company called Sportium to offer sports betting services from Gran Canaria.

This is great news for the island's economy, as it will create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue. It is also good news for sports fans, who will now be able to bet on their favorite teams and players from the comfort of their own home.

 Sportium is Spain's second largest bookmaker, so it is well-equipped to offer a high-quality betting service. The company has already opened an office on Gran Canaria and is hiring staff to get the operation up and running.

The move to Gran Canaria follows the recent legalization of online sports betting in Spain. This means that Spaniards can now bet on sports events anywhere in the world, using their laptop or smartphone.

Gran Canaria is well-placed to take advantage of this new market, as it has a well-developed telecommunications infrastructure and a talented workforce. The island is also home to several major gaming companies, which should help Sportium attract customers from all over Europe.

#  Is Gran Canaria the new sports betting capital of the world?

For years, Gibraltar has been seen as the sports betting capital of the world. But could Gran Canaria be challenging that status?

There’s no doubt that Gibraltar is a key player in the online gambling industry. The tiny British territory has long been seen as a tax haven and a gateway to Europe for online gaming companies. Its favourable regulatory environment and proximity to several major markets has helped make it a hub for the industry.

But could Gran Canaria be starting to compete with Gibraltar? The Spanish island has emerged as a major player in the online gambling market in recent years, thanks to its favourable tax conditions and relaxed licensing regime.

Many of the world’s leading online gambling companies have set up operations on Gran Canaria, including PokerStars, Bet365 and Bwin.party. The island is now home to more than 60 licensed gambling companies, employing over 4,000 people. And the industry is growing at a rapid pace – annual revenues from online gambling in Gran Canaria are now estimated at over €250 million.

So why are so many companies moving their operations to Gran Canaria? There are several reasons:

– First, Gran Canaria offers an attractive tax regime for gambling companies. Gambling companies based on the island pay just 4% corporate tax, compared to 20% in Gibraltar.

– Second, Gran Canaria has a very relaxed licensing regime. There is no need for gaming licences from either the local authorities or the national government; instead, operators can obtain licenses from private companies such as Bettingradar or EGBA. This makes it much easier to set up operations on the island.

– Third, Gran Canaria offers excellent telecommunications infrastructure and a well-educated workforce. This makes it easy for companies to operate their businesses from the island and recruit staff.

All of these factors have helped make Gran Canaria into a major hub for online gambling firms. And there’s no sign of this growth slowing down – in fact, it’s likely that the industry will continue to grow rapidly in coming years.
