#  Make Your Own Luck in the Irish Wishes Game

In Ireland, there is a popular game called Irish Wishes. It is a game where you make a wish and put a penny into a well, and then make another wish. If the first wish comes true, you keep the penny. If the second wish comes true, you give the penny away to someone else.

The game is believed to have originated from an old Irish saying: "May your first wish be a warning, your second wish be a favor, and your third wish be for luck."

While there is no surefire way to win at Irish Wishes, there are certain things you can do to increase your chances of making your wishes come true. Here are some tips:

1) Make thoughtful wishes. Don't just make wishes for things that you want for yourself. Make wishes for other people too – for their health, happiness, and prosperity. When you make desires that are selfless and kind, you create good karma which can help your wishes come true.

2) Have faith in yourself and in the universe. Believe that everything will work out for the best, and that your wishes will be granted if they are meant to be. Trust that the universe has your best interests at heart. This positive attitude will help bring about good fortune in your life.

3) Be patient. Don't expect all of your wishes to come true overnight – some may take time to manifest themselves. Allow the universe plenty of time to work its magic on your behalf so that all of your dreams can come true in due time.

4) Make a list of wishes and revisit it regularly. Each time you revisit your list of dreams and desires, add new ones or remove ones that have already been granted. This will keep you focused on what you want most out of life, and will help keep you positive and optimistic about the future.
