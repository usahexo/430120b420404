#  Study finds gambling addiction affects one third of addicts 

A recent study found that one third of gambling addicts struggle with a compulsive disorder. The study, which was published in the journal Addiction, also found that half of problem gamblers have a mental health disorder.

Researchers analyzed data from more than 2,500 people who had problems with gambling. They found that 33 percent of those people met the criteria for an addiction, while 49 percent met the criteria for a mental health disorder.

The most common mental health disorders among problem gamblers were depression, followed by anxiety and bipolar disorder.

The study's authors say their findings underscore the need for better prevention and treatment programs for problem gamblers.

"This large study confirms that problem gambling is not just a social or financial problem, but is also associated with significant mental health problems," said study author Dr. Marc Potenza. "Treating these underlying problems is critical to helping people overcome their addiction to gambling."

#  percentage of people affected by gambling

A recent study on gambling shows that nearly 50 percent of the American population has gambled at least once in their lives. This percentage is even higher for males, with nearly 60 percent admitting to gambling at some point in their lives. For females, the percentage is lower, but still significant at just over 40 percent.

When it comes to problem gambling, however, these numbers change dramatically. About 8 percent of the population experiences problems with gambling, which equates to roughly 22 million people. This number is significantly higher for men, who make up about 11 percent of all those with a gambling problem. Women comprise just 7 percent of the population with a gambling addiction.

These numbers paint a clear picture: gambling is a widespread activity that affects millions of people in different ways. Some gamble without any issues, while others find themselves struggling with an addiction. It’s important to be aware of these statistics and understand the risks associated with gambling before participating in this activity.
